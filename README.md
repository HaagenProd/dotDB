# dotDB
dotDB is a .NET Database Service WIP project.
I'm working on this project on my free time, dotDB is not ready for use yet. 
> I don't know if what I'm doing is done efficiently, but I started this project to improve myself, and maybe create something that can be used in other projects!

## The purpose of the project
The goal is to create a database system usable in C#, either through "queries" or APIs.
